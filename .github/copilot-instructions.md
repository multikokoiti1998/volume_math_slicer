# Copilot / AI agent instructions for this repository

Purpose
- Help AI coding agents become productive quickly on this Slicer extension-style CMake project.

Big picture
- This repo implements a Slicer module-like component under `volume_math/`. UI and module entry points live at [volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModule.cxx](volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModule.cxx) and [volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx](volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx).
- Processing logic is separated into the `Logic/` folder; primary processing lives in [volume_math/Logic/vtkSlicervolume_mathLogic.cxx](volume_math/Logic/vtkSlicervolume_mathLogic.cxx). The UI calls into the Logic layer — prefer changes in `Logic/` for algorithmic work and `qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx` for GUI wiring.
- Resources and UI definitions are under `volume_math/Resources/` (`.qrc`, `Icons/`, `UI/`). UI form files: [volume_math/Resources/UI/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.ui](volume_math/Resources/UI/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.ui).

Build & test (how developers build locally)
- Typical CMake workflow (run from repo root):
  - `mkdir -p build && cd build`
  - `cmake ..` (configure; pass Slicer-specific cmake flags if used in your environment)
  - `cmake --build . -- -j$(nproc)`
- Tests live under `volume_math/Testing/` and `volume_math/Testing/Cxx/`. Use CTest inside `build/` after configuring: `ctest -j2` or run the generated test targets.

Project-specific conventions & patterns
- Module naming: files and classes use the `qSlicervolume_math` / `vtkSlicervolume_math` prefix pattern; when adding new classes follow this prefix to match Slicer module conventions.
- Separation of concerns: GUI code in `qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.*`, logic in `Logic/`, and resources in `Resources/`. Avoid putting heavy computation in widget classes.
- CMake layout: there are `CMakeLists.txt` at the repo root and inside `volume_math/`, `volume_math/Logic/`, `volume_math/Widgets/`, and `volume_math/Testing/`. Make minimal, local CMake edits and prefer exposing targets via the module-level `CMakeLists.txt`.

Integration & dependencies
- This project expects Slicer/VTK/Qt-related libraries via CMake. Linking and include targets are configured in the module `CMakeLists.txt` files (see [volume_math/CMakeLists.txt](volume_math/CMakeLists.txt)).
- UI forms are compiled from `.ui` files and bundled via the `.qrc` resource file under `Resources/`.

How to make safe edits
- For algorithmic changes, modify or add classes under `volume_math/Logic/` and expose them via the module CMake. Add unit tests under `volume_math/Testing/Cxx/` and update the `Testing/CMakeLists.txt` accordingly.
- For GUI changes, update the `.ui` files under `Resources/UI/` and the widget implementation in `qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx`.

Examples (where to look)
- Module entry/registration: [volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModule.cxx](volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModule.cxx)
- Widget implementation: [volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx](volume_math/qSlicervolume_mathModuleWidget.cxx)
- Core logic: [volume_math/Logic/vtkSlicervolume_mathLogic.cxx](volume_math/Logic/vtkSlicervolume_mathLogic.cxx)

When you need clarification
- Ask the repo owner about Slicer version and any custom CMake flags used during CI or local development.
- If a change touches both UI and logic, request a short design note explaining expected user flows and sample data.

Notes for the next iteration
- If there are existing AI-agent instruction files, merge their section on workspace-specific policies and CI commands into this file.

If anything here is unclear or you want this in Japanese, say so and I will update accordingly.
